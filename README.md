# What is the NBA Title Belt?
The NBA Title Belt is an unofficial award made to spice up the regular season of the NBA. The belt works similarly to how championship belts work in boxing, MMA, or pro wrestling.

To start off the season, the belt is awarded to the winner of the previous season's NBA Finals. If that team is defeated then the belt goes to the team that won. The goal is to hold on to the belt until the end of the regular season.

This tradition originated from the Reddit forum /r/NBA several years ago but has since been forgotten, so I am hoping to bring it back.
